          <h1>Chilled Mobius</h1>
          <p>Everything is colder, characters wear mostly cold colours, and even the lava has cooled off.  Rings are <span style="color: var(--blue)">blue</span>!</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Cute Creativity</h1>
          <p>Just like the Undercute UT AU, characters have a bow somewhere and are cute in all areas</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Dancing Mobius</h1>
          <p>Everyone has the ability to dance right as they're born.  No specific styles yet.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Default</h1>
          <p>Every character can only ever use their default face.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Digital Mode</h1>
          <p>The world is futuristically and digitally styled, plus some sci-fi elements to boot!</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Emo-Type</h1>
          <p>All characters have an insecurity or the like, most go for just red and black themes — yes, Shadow is affected by this.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Epic Events</h1>
          <p>Everyone is just plain OP.</p><h1>Mobian Dreams</h1>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Gloomy Mobius</h1>
          <p>All characters are much sadder — yes, even Cream and Tails — and there's a lack of yellow.  Vanilla is more protective than ever.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Haven Heaven</h1>
          <p>Basically nothing that can make anyone sad is in this AU.  Cosmo and Maria both never died, and Shadow is a lot lighter.</p>
          <p>Also, flowers!</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Mobian Dreams</h1>
          <p>Sonic is in a coma, dreaming, and only his close friends and subconsious know.</p><br>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Magma Madness</h1>
          <p>All characters and areas now have fire themes to them, unless one already did in which case it's switched to ice.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Metallic Actions</h1>
          <p>Sonic is a robot, causing other characters to behave differently in areas.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Mobian Eclipses</h1>
          <p>Characters have either a solar or lunar theme to them.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Opposite Oddballs</h1>
          <p>Everyone and everything is the opposite.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Stylish Mobius</h1>
          <p>Every character has their own, fitting clothing style.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sonic in sports clothes</li>
            <li>more to come...</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br>
          
          <h1>Sugary Sweetness</h1>
          <p>Bright pastels and cheery themes — no one's ever down in this AU.  Characters even dissolve into sugar instead of dying!</p>
          
          <br>
