					<h2><a href="/sonic-aus/theme/basic-change/index.html">Basic Change</a></h2>
          
					<p>Every character is changed, but the basis of the story and the story itself is otherwise retained.</p>

						Positives - Mostly warm colours and personalities<br>
						Reflections - Characters can traverse through mirrors<br>

						Unexpected Events - ...happen to the characters</p>
          
          
          
					<h2><a href="/sonic-aus/theme/concept-change/index.html">Concept Change</a></h2>

					<h2><a href="/sonic-aus/theme/new-setting/index.html">New Setting</a></h2>
          
					<p>Self-explanatory.  Characters may have their designs changed to fit.</p>
          
					<p>Playtime - Everyone but Sonic lives inside a younger Sonic's phone<br>

					<h2><a href="/sonic-aus/theme/species-swap/index.html">Species Swap</a></h2>
          
					<p>Self-explanatory again.  Characters may have their designs changed to fit.</p>

					<p>Characters switch their roles and/or personalities around.</p>

					<p>Alteration - Shadow and Blaze switch.  Silver and Anita have yet to switch with other characters. - Based off of Altertale<br>
						It All Differs - Minor and major characters switch roles<br>
						Swapped Up - Sonic and Tails switch; Shadow and Rouge; Amy and Cream - Inspired by Underswap<br>
						Shifted Mobius - Pairs shift in a cycle, keeping their personalities with them. Sonic and Tails → Amy and Cream → Shadow and Rouge - Inspired by Storyshift<br>
						Spun Around - Shifted, but the other way around<br>
						Reverted Swaps - Swapped gets undone, but the personalities stay based on role</p>
          
          
          
					<h2><a href="/sonic-aus/theme/special-event/index.html">Special Event</a></h2>
          
					<p>Everything would be the same if it weren't for something happening after the beginning that affects most characters.  Changing when Sonic was around counts too.</p>
          
					<p>A Late Start - Characters progress (and age) 100 years aside from Sonic<br>
						Early Bird - Sonic's whole family stays, but everything else rewinds 100 years</p>
