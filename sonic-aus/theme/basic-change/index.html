					<h1>Astray</h1>
					<p>Some characters' lives have gone astray—</p>
					<p><span style="color: var(--orange)">Astray!Tails: [crying] COOOOOOOSSSSMMMOOOooo!!!!...</span></p>
					<p>...yeah</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Chilled Mobius</h1>
					<p>Everything is colder, characters wear mostly cold colours, and even the lava has cooled off.  Rings are <span style="color: var(--blue)">blue</span>!</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Cute Creativity</h1>
					<p>Just like the Undercute UT AU, characters have a bow somewhere and are cute in all areas</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Dancing Mobius</h1>
					<p>Everyone has the ability to dance right as they're born.  No specific styles yet.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Default</h1>
					<p>Every character can only ever use their default face.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Digital Mode</h1>
					<p>The world is futuristically and digitally styled, plus some sci-fi elements to boot!</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Emo-Type</h1>
					<p>All characters have an insecurity or the like, most go for just red and black themes — yes, Shadow is affected by this.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Epic Events</h1>
					<p>Everyone is just plain OP.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Fallen Mobius</h1>
					<p>Most characters are somewhat more evil, enough to separate Sonic and Tails.  The black-red-gold theme from Underfell is also carried over.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Gend-Bend</h1>
					<p>Everyone is genderbent, including the names.  Sonica, Tailsko, etc.</p>
					<p>This AU was and is still being made by Tails and Sonic Pals.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>6l17ch3d!</h1>
					<p>For some reason, character personalities and colours have been affected by a glitch.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Gloomy Mobius</h1>
					<p>All characters are much sadder — yes, even Cream and Tails — and there's a lack of yellow.  Vanilla is more protective than ever.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Haven Heaven</h1>
					<p>Basically nothing that can make anyone sad is in this AU.  Cosmo and Maria both never died, and Shadow is a lot lighter.</p>
					<p>Also, flowers!</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Hopeless</h1>
					<p>All characters, aside from Sonic, need HOPE to live on.  The more hopeless a character is, the more pale their colours are.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Magma Madness</h1>
					<p>All characters and areas now have fire themes to them, unless one already did in which case it's switched to ice.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Metallic Actions</h1>
					<p>Sonic is a robot, causing other characters to behave differently in areas.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Mobian Dreams</h1>
					<p>Sonic is in a coma, dreaming, and only his close friends and subconsious know.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Mobian Eclipses</h1>
					<p>Characters have either a solar or lunar theme to them.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Negatives</h1>
					<p>Mostly <span style="color: var(--skyblue)">c</span><span style="color: var(--cyan)">o</span><span style="color: var(--aquagreen)">l</span><span style="color: var(--green)">d</span> colours and personalities</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Opposite Oddballs</h1>
					<p>Everyone and everything is the opposite.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Personality Flip</h1>
					<p>Aside from the characters' likes, dislikes, lives, hates, hobbies, passions, jobs, etc., all character personalities are flipped.</p>
					<p>The idea for this AU was made by SEGA themselves for Sonic Boom.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Positives</h1>
					<p>Mostly <span style="color: var(--hotpink)">w</span><span style="color: var(--red)">a</span><span style="color: var(--orange)">r</span><span style="color: var(--yellow)">m</span> colours and personalities</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Reflections</h1>
					<p>Characters can traverse through mirrors, Alice in Wonderland-style.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Stylish Mobius</h1>
					<p>Every character has their own, fitting clothing style.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sonic in sports clothes</li>
						<li>Tails in a lab coat, or his Boom outfit?  I'm not sure.</li>
						<li>more to come...</li>
					</ul>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Soulborn</h1>
					<p>Just like the Undertale AU,two characters can combine parts of their SOULs to create a new character — one houses the developing SOUL and the other lends energy.  Both males and females can become mothers and fathers in this AU.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<h1>Sugar Mix / Sugary Sweetness</h1>
					<p>Bright pastels and cheery themes — no one's ever down in this AU.  Characters even dissolve into sugar instead of dying!</p>
					
					<br>
          
          				<h1>Unexpected Events</h1>
					<p>The most unexpected of events happen to the characters.  Sonic isn't even into speed due to running without a care in the world into a wall.</p>
					<!-- yo, Unexpected!Sonic! I had the same thing happen to me once as a child! -->
					
					<br>
